      the main interest of this project was to work with a material with a strong identity that defines a particular object: the vinyl record. The goal was to reuse damaged objects, deconstruct and reconstruct it to give form to a new object with a different function. The handmade vinyl eyewear that came out from this concept acquire an added value for the user, that  will wear an highly valuable object as holder of memories and history of music.
